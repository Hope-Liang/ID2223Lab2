## Introduction

In this project, the goal is to fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model (Whisper) for Swedish language translation, refactor it into a feature pipeline and a training pipeline and build a serverless UI for using the fine-tuned model. The pipeline structure uses Hopsworks/Google Drive/KTH OneDrive as feature store, Google Drive/Hugging face as model store and Hugging face as interactive UI to build applications. The interactive UI takes user's speech record as input and prints the recognized spoken sentence.
